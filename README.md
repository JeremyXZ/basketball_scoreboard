A solo project from Scrimba's "The Frontend Developer Career Path", a course I've been doing for a while. 

I've just completed a CSS course -- "CSS for JavaScript Developers"-- and wanted to practice my CSS skills.  CSS has always been the bottleneck of my web development tasks and I've put off doing a few projects due to my reluctance to handle CSS in them. This project is relatively simple and hence a good starting  for me to put my newly acquired skills into practice. Hopefully, I can carrying on practising my CSS skills with some of the projects .
